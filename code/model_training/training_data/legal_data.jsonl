The Eleventh Circuits stated as follows: Younger established that, based on principles of comity and federalism, a federal court should not interfere with ongoing state criminal proceedings where the state court conviction and/or sentence is not yet final. See id. at 43-45, 91 S.Ct. 746.

Id. There are three narrow exceptions to the abstention doctrine: (1) there is evidence of state proceedings motivated by bad faith; (2) irreparable injury would occur; or (3) there is no adequate alternative state forum where the constitutional issues can be raised.

'First, based upon the evidence presented, the Court believes that 250 Fourth is interpreting Section 14.1.2 as requiring that the entire Project be suspended, delayed or interrupted, rather than the entire 'Work.' 'Work' is defined in the Contract as '[t]he construction and services required by the Contract Documents, whether completed or partially completed' and 'may constitute the whole or a part of the Project.' Since Work includes the whole or a part of the Project, it is difficult to discern what is meant by suspending, delaying or interrupting the 'entire' Work, which would be comprised of many different tasks. The Court finds that a reasonable interpretation of this ambiguity is that it is not referencing the entire 'Project,' which is defined as 'the total construction of the work performed under the Contract Documents that may be the whole or a part and which may include construction by the Owner and by separate contractor.' It is referencing the Work required by the Contract in order to achieve timely completion of the Project. In other words, repeated delays or interruptions that break the continuity or progress of the Work. 'Second, Section 14.1.2 references suspension, delay or interruption of the Work by the Owner for 120 days in any 365-day period. 250 Fourth's assertion that Whiting-Turner's notice of termination was improper appears to focus on the suspension aspect of Section 14.1.2, not the delay or interruption options. The Court finds that the evidence presented establishes that delays on the critical path resulting from Virgin's multiple ongoing design changes and modifications resulted in sufficient delays and interruptions to the progress towards completion of the entire Work. [\u00b6] These delays and interruptions occurred through no act or fault of Whiting Turner or any of its subcontractors . . . and resulted in Whiting-Turner's inability to coordinate and sequence ongoing and upcoming work.
