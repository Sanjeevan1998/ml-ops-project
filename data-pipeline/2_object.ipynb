    "## Using object storage\n",
    "\n",
    "Until now, in any experiment we have run on Chameleon, we had to re-download large training sets each time we launched a new compute instance to work on that data. For example, in our “GourmetGram” use case, we had to re-download the Food11 dataset each time we brought up a compute instance to train or evaluate a model on that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a longer-term project, we will want to persist large data sets beyond the lifetime of the compute instance. That way, we can download a very large data set *once* and then re-use it many times with different compute instances, without having to keep a compute instance “alive” all the time, or re-download the data. We will use the object storage service in Chameleon to enable this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of the various types of storage available in a cloud computing environment (object, block, file), object storage is the most appropriate for large training data sets. Object storage is cheap, and optimized for storing and retrieving large volumes of data, where the data is not modified frequently. (In object storage, there is no in-place modification of objects - only replacement - so it is not the best solution for files that are frequently modified.)\n",
    "\n",
    "After you run this experiment, you will know how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   create an object store container at CHI@TACC\n",
    "-   copy objects to it,\n",
    "-   and mount it as a filesystem in a compute instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The object storage service is available at CHI@TACC or CHI@UC. In this tutorial, we will use CHI@TACC. The CHI@TACC object store can be accessed from a KVM@TACC VM instance."
